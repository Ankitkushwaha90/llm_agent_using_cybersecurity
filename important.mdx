# Intelligent Information Gathering and Vulnerability Exploitation Using LLMs in Cybersecurity

## Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive approach to intelligent information gathering, vulnerability detection, and exploit recommendation in cybersecurity using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA 2, Mistral, and fine-tuned BERT/DistilBERT. The proposed system integrates Hugging Face Transformers for model training and deployment, PyTorch for fine-tuning, FastAPI for RESTful interaction, and Ollama for efficient local model inference. Leveraging cybersecurity datasets including CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, and the MITRE ATT\&CK corpus, along with FAISS-based vector search, the system achieves advanced situational awareness and actionable insights in penetration testing and defense operations.

## 1. Introduction

Effective cybersecurity relies heavily on efficient information gathering and timely identification of vulnerabilities. Manual processes often fall short due to the scale and complexity of modern attack surfaces. The use of LLMs presents a unique opportunity to enhance these processes through natural language understanding, contextual awareness, and dynamic response capabilities.

## 2. Related Work

Prior works have explored static analysis, rule-based threat detection, and supervised machine learning for identifying attack patterns. This study extends these foundations by integrating NLP-based LLMs for automated reconnaissance, correlation of threat indicators, and real-time exploit suggestion.
